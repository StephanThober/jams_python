# This is the Python package of JAMS.

JAMS is a general Python package offering miscellaneous functions in different
categories, such as reading different file formats, julian date routines, or
meteorological functions.

It has several subpackages offering constants, working with eddy covariance data
and software such as EddySoft, offering special functions, or objective
functions be used with scipy.optimize.fmin or scipy.optimize.curvefit, and much
more.

### Installation

The library is maintained with a git repository at:

    https://github.com/mcuntz/jams_python/

To use it, checkout the git repository

    git clone https://github.com/mcuntz/jams_python.git

and either add it to your Python path, for example in bash:

    export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/the/jams/package

or install it with setup.py after changing into the downloaded directory:

    python setup.py install

or install it with pip:

    pip install ./

One can also install it directly with pip from the git repository:

    pip install git+https://github.com/mcuntz/jams_python.git

Append --user on pip commands if you have no root access.


---------------------------------------------------------------

### Documentation

The documentation of the package is in the docstring of __init__.py so
that one can get help on the Python prompt:  
\>\>\> import jams  
\>\>\> help(jams)

The individual functions also provide their help as doctrings.  
Getting help, for example, on fread for reading numbers from an ascii file:  
\>\>\> import jams  
\>\>\> help(jams.fread)

or  
\>\>\> from jams import fread  
\>\>\> help(fread)

One can produce html versions of the documentation in a directory
called html by calling the script:

    ./bin/makehtml jams
    ./bin/makehtml jams/eddybox

This script works only for the one directory and not on subdirectories, i.e. subpackages.  
A more complete documentation is therefore given by opening a documentation server with

    pydoc -p 1024

Open browser (b) and select `jams (package)`, or open the url

    http://localhost:1024/jams.html

in a web browser.


---------------------------------------------------------------

### Dependencies

The package is compatible with Python 2 (> 2.6) and 3 (> 3.2).  
Note that all packages but one used by the package are already Python 3 ready (except pyhdf).  
Reading HDF4 files is thus disabled in python 3.

The package uses different third-party packages if they are
installed. Otherwise the functions are disabled. For example, reading
of special files needs netCDF4 for netcdf and pyhdf/h5py for
HDF4/HDF5, resp. If the latter are not installed, the functions
readhdf, readhdf4, readhdf5 are disabled.

Essential third-party packages, which are given as dependencies in setup.py, are numpy, scipy, netcdf4, and matplotlib.

The full list of all third-party packages used is:  
bottleneck, bs4, cartopy, cdsapi, ecmwfapi, h5py, matplotlib, mpi4py, netCDF4, networkx, numpy, pandas, pygraphviz, pyhdf, schwimmbad, scipy, seaborn, tkinter, wx, xlrd.
